# love-console

Simple Counter-Strike-like console for LÃ–VE games 

## What is it?

Tap `` ` `` to toggle console visibility:

![In action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamsterready/love-console/master/shot.png)

When console is visible it can consume ``love.keypressed`` and ``love.mousepressed`` callbacks (if you wish it to). If you do not want to pass events to console callbacks then you can always open console by calling ``console.visible = true``.

Useful for simple debugging and changing game parameters in runtime.

## How to use it?

Check [main.lua](https://github.com/hamsterready/love-console/blob/master/main.lua) for complete example.

Minimum working example:

```lua

-- load and initialize console with defaults 
local console = require 'console'

function love.draw()
	-- draw console, should be last statement in love.draw function,
	-- otherwsie other elements may be drawn on top of it
  console.draw()
end

function love.keypressed(key)
  -- let console consume keypress events, if only it is visible
  -- should be first code block in love.keypressed function
  if console.keypressed(key) then
    return
  end
end

function love.resize( w, h )
	-- if your application window is resizable, 
	-- then update console with new width and height
  console.resize(w, h)
end


function love.mousepressed(x, y, button)
  -- let the console consume wheel up and down mosuepress events
  -- (only when console is visible)
  -- should be first code block in love.mousepressed function
  if console.mousepressed(x, y, button) then
    return 
  end
end

```

## API

 - `` console.load(keyCode, fontSize, keyRepeat, inputCallback) `` - initializes console
   - ``keyCode`` - KeyConstant, default `` ` ``, it is used to toggle console visibility
   - ``fontSize`` - number, default 20
   - ``keyRepeat`` - boolean, default false
   - ``inputCallback`` - function, if ``nil`` is being passed then default implementation is being used, see ``console.lua`` file for details

 - `` console.draw() `` - draws console,

   console position and size ``x, y, w, h = 0, 0, windowWidth, windowHeight/5``; please remember to call ``console.resize()`` so that ``w, h`` can be recomputed

 - `` console.update(dt) `` - updates console state with ``dt`` time, not required, but strongly recommended
   - ``dt`` - delta time

 - `` console.resize(w, h) `` - call when window is resized, not required but recommended when your application window is resizable
   - ``w`` - new window width
   - ``h`` - new window height

 - `` console.keypressed(key) `` - handles keypress events
   - ``key`` - KeyConstant

   shall be invoked as first block in ``love.keypressed(key)``; returns true if key was consumed by console, false otherwise

   this one is rather required, it allows to toggle console visibility without pain and you do not have to deal with visibility state, however you can always use ``console.visible = true or false`` to show/hide the console

 - `` console.mousepressed(x, y, button) `` - handles mousepress events
  - ``x`` - mouse position
  - ``y`` - mouse position
  - ``button`` - mouse button being pressed

  calling this method allows console to support scrolling through messages (if only console is visible )

 shall be invoked as first block in ``love.mousepressed(x, y, button)``; returns true if button was consumed by console, false otherwise

 - `` console.d(t), console.i(t), console.e(t) `` - append ``debug``, ``info`` or ``error`` message to the console
 - `` t `` - string, message content

- `console.defineCommand(name, description, implementation)` - Define a command like `/help`.
  - `name` - The name of the command which must include the forward-slash (if desired).
  - `description` - An explanation of the command shown by `/help`.
  - `implementation` - A function providing the logic for the command.  It receives no arguments and the package ignores any return values.
